Add all of the following input booleans to your configuration (i use split up yaml files in my config)

occupied:
  name: Home Occupied
  initial: off
  icon: mdi:home
himhome:
  name: Him Home
  initial: off
  icon: mdi:account
herhome:
  name: Her Home
  initial: off
  icon: mdi:account
kid1home:
  name: Kid1 Home
  initial: off
  icon: mdi:account
kid2home:
  name: Kid2 Home
  initial: off
  icon: mdi:account
houseguests:
  name: House Guests
  initial: off
  icon: mdi:account-group
vacation:
  name: Vacation Mode
  initial: off
  icon: mdi:airplane

Create an input_boolean for each individual you want to track, plus one for guests, and one to set the house for vacation mode.
You can create as many as you need, and if you have any other presence related switches (maid/housekeeper, etc.)

These will all get connected to the automation
