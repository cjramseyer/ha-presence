Add the following to the configuration.yaml to get this working

device_tracker:
  - platform: google_maps
    username: !secret presence_user

input_boolean: !include input_boolean.yaml

Follow the instructions on the HA website to setup the Google Maps integration ([link](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/google_maps/).
Create a NEW and SEPARATE google account just for your HA setup (my personal account has 2fa enabled which will not work for this)
